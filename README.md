# About me
### Hello, My name is Harry Willoughby, 17 years old, and I am currently studying A-Level Computer Science at BHASVIC in Brighton, with an interest in working in an industry related to this subject long-term. I've already been given an idea of what this would be like as I've done work experience, designing and coding a web front end to be used within the company I was working for, to increase the ease of use of the program which they'd already written, but could only be run in the terminal. I really enjoyed this and would want to explore further into similar roles/industries. 
### Currently, I'm working on my own tower defence style game that will go towards my final A-Level grade, taking inspiration from well known and loved games like "Plants Vs. Zombies" and "Bloons TD", which I am very excited for and am going to be learning C# in unity for (I already have experience coding in Python, C, Java and HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
### I'm passionate to learn about more surrounding the subject and the opportunities it could present me with, as I'm going to study Computer Science further at University.
### I'm a colaborative worker who's capable as acting as the leader and am able to be led when working in a team, I consistently meet deadlines and am a clear, consistent communicator. All skills I have exercised when completing group projects with classmates at college.
